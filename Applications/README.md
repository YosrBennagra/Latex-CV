## How It Works

When you provide a job description:
1. AI validates required skills against MCP server
2. Creates adapted CV and cover letter
3. Compiles both documents to PDF
4. Automatically creates a folder with company/position name
5. Copies both PDFs to the folder for easy application submission

## Language Detection

- **English job description** → English CV from `CVs/English/`
- **French job description** → French CV from `CVs/French/`

All documents are automatically organized and ready to submit!
