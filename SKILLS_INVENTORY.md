## 📌 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CV ADAPTATION

### ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: Before adapting any CV

**WHEN YOU RECEIVE A JOB DESCRIPTION:**

1. **STOP and analyze the job requirements**
2. **Identify ALL technologies/skills mentioned in the job description**
3. **Cross-reference with SKILLS_INVENTORY.md:**
   - List skills from job that are in "✅ SKILLS I HAVE"
   - List skills from job that are in "❌ SKILLS I DO NOT HAVE"
   - **MOST IMPORTANT:** List any NEW skills not mentioned in EITHER section
4. **ASK ME BEFORE PROCEEDING:**
   - "I found these NEW skills in the job description: [list]"
   - "Do you have experience with: [skill1], [skill2], [skill3]?"
   - Wait for my confirmation before adding anything to the CV

### When adapting the CV for a new job:

1. Read the job description carefully
2. Check this SKILLS_INVENTORY.md file
3. **ASK about any new skills not in this inventory**
4. ONLY include skills from the "✅ SKILLS I HAVE" section
5. NEVER add skills from the "❌ SKILLS I DO NOT HAVE" section
6. Reorganize and prioritize skills based on job requirements
7. Update the role/title to match the job posting
8. Rewrite the summary (max 340 characters) to emphasize relevant skills
9. Keep all experience and projects unchanged - these are factual records

### If a job requires a skill I don't have:
- Do NOT add it to the CV
- Focus on related skills I do have
- Emphasize my ability to learn quickly and adapt
- Mention relevant transferable skills

### Before submitting any adapted CV:
- Verify every skill listed is in the "✅ SKILLS I HAVE" section
- Ensure no skills from "❌ SKILLS I DO NOT HAVE" were added
- Confirm all dates, companies, and achievements are unchanged
- Confirm I approved any new skills that were added to the inventory
